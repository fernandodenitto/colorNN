# colorNN
A neural network for the comparison of two colours in ad Industrial Context

The project involves an industrial process of copying colors. In particular, the goal of the project is as follows (as shown in the text): in order to objectively compare a copy to a master, it is required to design and develop a neural net- work, which must be designed and trained to measure the difference between two similar colors. From an operational point of view, the network takes as in- put the representations of a master color and of a copy, and returns their color difference. To calculate the difference between two colors, you use a machine- independent color space called CIE Lab.
